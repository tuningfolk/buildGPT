Let's see how far we can get with this one.

Broadcasting:
    Align the dimensions of the two operands to the right
    and then check each pair of dimensions
Train - (used to train the parameters)  
Validation - (used to train the hyperparameters)  
Test - (used to evaluate the perfomance at the end)  
  
As the model gets more complex and deeper, it becomes less forgiving, ie you need to be fine tune your hyperparameters very scrupulously.
